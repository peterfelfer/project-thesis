The visualization-concept of this thesis is to perform several tasks consecutively, which are listed below:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Voxelization of the raw data using a Contribution Transfer function
	\item Isosurface Extraction
	\item Centroidal Voronoi Tesselation - CVT
	\item Calculation of proximity histograms
	
\end{enumerate}

Each step is described further in the chapter Methods.
