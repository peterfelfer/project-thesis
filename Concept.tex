\chapter{Concept}
\label{concept}

The aim of this thesis is to develop an implementation of iso-surface algorithms that is producing a highly regular mesh, suitable for analysis algorithms for point clouds, specifically APT data, in the lateral direction. These algorithms are based on dual mesh type iso-surfaces and centroidal Voronoi tessellations.

The visualization-concept of this thesis is to perform several tasks consecutively, which are listed below:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Voxelization of the raw data using a Contribution Transfer function
	\item Isosurface Extraction
	\item Centroidal Voronoi Tesselation - CVT
	\item Calculation of proximity histograms
	
\end{enumerate}

Each step is described further in the chapter Methods.
